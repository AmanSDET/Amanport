                        <p>Hello! My name is Aman, and I’m passionate about ensuring the quality of the products people rely on. My journey into quality assurance began in 2016 during my internship as a Java developer. It was there that I realized ensuring the quality of a product is just as critical, if not more so, than building it. I quickly learned how essential thorough testing is to creating reliable software.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p> Since then, I’ve had the chance to work alongside talented teams, honing my skills in testing and quality assurance. These days, I focus on ensuring that products are robust, accessible even in remote areas, and user-friendly. I also enjoy exploring test automation and innovative QA strategies whenever possible.</p>
